# Milestone 2 Reflection

Overall, our app does a good job of letting users who are not familiar with data analysis to explore the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) data both for all of Canada and for specific regions and time ranges. It has all the basic functionalities working though aesthetics can be improved and functionalities expanded. Below is a summary of what has been completed and what we would like to improve or add:

### Features we completed:
- Allows users to explore the NAPS data in a much more straightforward and easy way
- All user inputs are functioning and adjust the plots appropriately while being straightforward and easy to use 
- The map shows the density of the pollutants over different regions in Canada.
- Radar plot shows the aggregate distribution of the pollutants for the selected range
- The stacked bar chart shows the breakdown of the pollutants over selected time range.
- The line plot shows the monthly aggregate of the selected pollutants in the selected province and cities.
- Definitions for the pollutants allows users to know the meaning of the acronyms used

### Features we need to improve or add: 
- Adding instructions for how to deselect options (maybe make more intuitive by using pickerInput)
- Adding aesthetics to the layout
- Adding more information about the pollutants so non-experts know their significance
- Include all 20 years of data by limiting initial range or aggregating to monthly data
- Group data wrangling for bar chart and line chart
- Add world data for further usability and comparisons.
- Add assumptions or constraints used in building the dashboard
