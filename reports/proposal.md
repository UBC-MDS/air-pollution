## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data scientist activist group

Target audience: Concerned Canadian Citizens

Air pollutants are increasingly impacting the health and quality of life of Canadians and their levels are tracked across Canada on an hourly basis by the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) Program in Canada. This data is however stored in hard to understand data files on a yearly basis and is not very accessible to regular Canadians. To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows all Canadians to visually explore the dataset of NAPS to better understand the changing trends of air pollution in Canada. Our app will show how the levels of various air pollutants, such as CO2 and NO2, have changed from 2001-2020 and allow users to explore different aspects of this data by selecting different pollutants and zooming in to the province and city level. We hope to also include the OECD air pollution data so users can also compare Canada to other countries around the world.
