# Air Pollution Dashboard Proposal (Group 13)

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role:** Data scientist activist group

**Target audience:** Concerned Canadian Citizens

Air pollutants are increasingly impacting the health and quality of life of Canadians and their levels are tracked across Canada on an hourly basis by the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) Program in Canada. This data is however stored in hard to understand data files on a yearly basis and is not very accessible to regular Canadians. To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows all Canadians to visually explore the dataset of NAPS to better understand the changing trends of air pollution in Canada. Our app will show how the levels of various air pollutants, such as CO2 and NO2, have changed from 2001-2020 and allow users to explore different aspects of this data by selecting different pollutants and zooming in to the province and city level. We hope to also include the OECD air pollution data so users can also compare Canada to other countries around the world. 

## Section 2: Description of the Data

We are using the [National Air Pollution Surveillance Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-pollution/monitoring-networks-data/national-air-pollution-program.html) data, published by the Government of Canada. Established in 1969 to monitor and assess the quality of ambient (outdoor) air in the populated regions of Canada, it applies the same measurement standards across provinces. We are using twenty years of aggregated data from 2001 to 2020 (inclusive), including daily average measurement of each site. Each record contains the date, the site (GPS location with city and territory names), as well as the measurement itself. It contains measurement of the following pollutants: CO, NO2, NO, NOX, O3, SO3, together with the PM10 and PM25 particles. The scripts we are using to convert into daily measurement data is [open and published under a separate repository (WIP)](https://github.com/netsgnut/naps-daily-data). This is licensed under the [Open Government License - Canada](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada).

To cross-reference Canada against other comparable developed countries, we are also using [OECD data on Air and GHG emissions](https://data.oecd.org/air/air-and-ghg-emissions.htm). While, admittedly, the collection method of both programs may not be entirely comparable, we believe that the OECD data is sufficient as a complement of the Canadian data we are using. The use of the OECD data is governed by [the OECD Terms and Conditions](https://www.oecd.org/termsandconditions/).

## Section 3: Research Questions

Sarah watches the news every evening and recently there have been frequent reports of poor air quality around the world. She is growing concerned about how certain pollutants will harm her health as a resident of Windsor, Ontario. She logs on to the Government of Canada's website and is overwhelemed by the raw data. She wants to _explore_ the data reported by the Canadian government's website by _identifying_ the quantity of the pollutants present in her province and city. She also wants to _compare_ the trend of those pollutants over the years. Sarah opens the "Air Pollution app". She first sees a map showing the current quantity of the major pollutants: CO, NO2, NO, NOX, O3, and SO2 in different regions of Canada. Beside the map is a line chart showing how the quantity of each pollutant in parts per million has changed over the years providing her with context. To focus the results, she filters the visualizations for the region she lives in by using a drop-down menu of Candadian provinces and cities. She is also only interested in the air quality in recent years so using the slider she filters for the year 2000 onwards. Since she would like to find out what particulates are present where she lives, she switches the tab from a line chart to a bar chart which shows the current composition of air pollution. She notices that Ozone (O3) is the biggest threat in her area. With this information, Sarah filters using the checkboxes options for pollutants to focus the line chart on the trend of O3. She realizes that the air is not as clean as she had hoped. Sarah organizes a meeting with other concerned citizens to raise awareness and inform people how to take precautions against poor air-quality.
