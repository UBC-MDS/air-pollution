## Description


The objective of this dashboard it to enable users to make inferences on the the air pollution trends in Canada between 2001 to 2020. These inferences are conveniently put in perspective by displaying comparisons with world metrics.

The landing page presents the user with options on the left side to select a Province in Canada or/and a specific City in Canada via drop-down menus. The pollutants of interest can be selected via checkboxes. By default, these options are set as entire Canada and all pollutants. This corresponds to the following selections, Select Province: "All" , Select City: Inactive, Select Pollutant: "All".

These selected options dynamically update the Line chart in the display zone 1 on the far right. This plot shows a comparison of average concentration (parts per million) of the prominent pollutants in Canada against the World. The default range of year for this chart is from 2001 to 2020. The user can alter this range by using a slider widget placed beneath this display zone. Furthermore, the user can switch between a Line Chart or Stacked Bar Chart option by clicking the respective buttons at the top of this display zone. Clicking either button fills the display zone 1 with the respective chart. At any moment only one type of chart is displayed in this zone allowing the user to fully immerse in the details.

The dashboard flaunts another display zone 2 at the center wherein the geospatial information is shown. This information dynamically updates based on the selected options in cohesion with the line or bar chart. This zone is divided into two halves. The upper half displays the density of selected air pollutants in the selected province or city in Canada. The bottom half displays the country-wise average density of the selected pollutants.

The dashboard provides definitions of the pollutants, model assumptions and a summary to provide an overall insight. The attributions and credits are enlisted for user convenience.
