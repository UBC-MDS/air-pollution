# Milestone 4 Reflection

Overall, the creation of this app has been an educational and interesting experience. We were able to implement most of what we wanted to and we were able to further improve our app from its initial state in Milestone 2. The team is proud of what we have accomplished.

### Has it been easy to use your app?

-   The app is easy to use, but it is a little slow to load. This may be accommodated for by using a paid deployment server, but it is reasonable for now

### Are there recurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?

-   People tended to like the clear design and ease-of-use
-   People requested more interactivity which we have implemented using plotly
-   People suggested adding a visualization to compare neighboring cities.

### What we have implemented:

-   Implemented the descriptions of the individual pollutants as popovers to allow interested users to learn more as per their interests.
-   Expanded the dataset to include 20 years of data between 2001 to 2020.
-   Added instruction on deselecting the selections on the UI interface.
-   Added seasonal plot to provide the average monthly pollutant levels over the selected timeframe by the user.

### What is not yet implemented:

-   Add world data for further usability and comparisons (we didn't
-   Add visualizations to compare the pollution levels with neighboring cities
-   More informative progress bars
-   Add a leaflet heatmap to show pollutant levels
